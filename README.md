Control your **Daikin / Airzone "DKN Cloud NA"** air-conditioning units from
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). Each unit becomes a full
climate entity — power, mode, target temperature and fan speed — with live
status updates.

This integration works with the units managed by the **DKN Cloud NA** mobile
app (the **ES.DKNWSERVER** Wi-Fi adapter, sold for Daikin systems in North
America). It connects to the same cloud service the app uses, so it works with
DKN Cloud NA accounts that other Daikin/Airzone integrations don't support.

## Features

- 🌡️ **Climate entity per unit** — on/off, HVAC mode (auto, cool, heat, fan, dry),
  current temperature, target temperature, fan speed, and louvre swing (where the
  unit supports it).
- 📊 **Diagnostic sensors** — outdoor temperature, Wi-Fi signal, outdoor-unit
  current draw and air quality (PM1 / PM2.5 / PM10), shown only when the hardware
  reports them.
- 🚦 **Status sensors** — connectivity and fault/problem binary sensors per unit.
- ⚡ **Live updates** — state is pushed in real time; the integration does not
  poll, so it stays responsive without hammering the service.
- 🏢 **Multiple homes/zones** — every installation and unit on your account is
  added automatically.
- 🌎 **°F or °C** — follows each unit's own temperature setting.

## Requirements

- A **DKN Cloud NA** account (the same email and password you use in the app),
  with your units already set up and online in the app.
- Home Assistant 2024.12 or newer.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. In Home Assistant, open **HACS**.
2. Click the **⋮** menu (top-right) → **Custom repositories**.
3. Add the repository URL `https://github.com/Suds-Lab/hass-daikin-dkn-na`
   and choose the category **Integration**, then **Add**.
4. Search for **DKN Cloud NA** and click **Download**.
5. **Restart** Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/dkn_cloud_na` folder from this repository into
   your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. **Restart** Home Assistant.

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **DKN Cloud NA**.
3. Sign in with your DKN Cloud NA **email** and **password**.

Your installations and units are discovered automatically and appear as
`climate` entities, ready to use on dashboards, in automations and with voice
assistants.

## Notes & limitations

- This is a **cloud** integration: it requires an internet connection and a
  working DKN Cloud NA account. There is no local-only control for the stock
  ES.DKNWSERVER adapter.
- A unit shows as *unavailable* in Home Assistant whenever it is offline or
  unreachable in the DKN Cloud NA app.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid authentication"** — double-check the email/password by signing in
  with the DKN Cloud NA app; the integration uses the same credentials.
- **No units appear** — make sure the units are online in the app first, then
  reload the integration from **Settings → Devices & Services**.
